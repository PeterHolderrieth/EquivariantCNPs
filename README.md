### Equivariant Conditional Neural Processes

In this repository, you can find an implementation of a model which I developped as part
of my master's dissertation. It it called a meta-learning method which exploits the geometry of data
called **Equivariant Conditional Neural Processes**.

Equivariant Conditional Neural Processes are an extension of Conditional Neural Processes. The image above depicts example
predictions of the EquivCNP in the case of vector fields. Inputs are the red arrows and the model extract the whole
vector field.
