### Equivariant Conditional Neural Processes

In this repository, you can find an implementation and extensive experiment of Equivariant Conditional Neural 
Processes, a meta-learning method which exploits the geometry of data.
This project was part my master's dissertation supervised by Professor
Yee Whye Teh (University of Oxford, Google DeepMind) and co-supervised by Michael Hutchinson
(University of Oxford).

Equivariant Conditional Neural Processes are an extension of Conditional Neural Processes. The image above depicts example
predictions of the EquivCNP in the case of vector fields. Inputs are the red arrows and the model extract the whole
vector field.
