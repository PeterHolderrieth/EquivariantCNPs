This task contains two square coordinate excerpts from subtropical
climate zones:
1. In the US Southeast --> around Louisana, Arkansas, etc.
2. In Southeastern China

The goal is to train the models on one (maybe the US) and let it predict
on the Chinese data. By this, we can see how the model is able to infer general
climate data mechansim and not relying on the place itself.
