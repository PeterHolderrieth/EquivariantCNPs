This task contains two square coordinate excerpts from subtropical
climate zones:
1. In the US Southeast --> around Louisana, Arkansas, etc.
2. In Southeastern China

The goal is to train the models on one (maybe the US) and let it predict
on the Chinese data. By this, we can see how the model is able to infer general
climate data mechansim and not relying on the place itself.

The data is obtained from https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=form
and the variables are:
2m temperature
Surface pressure
10m u-component of wind
10m v-component of wind

Years: 1990 - 2018
Month: January
Days, Time: All

The North-South difference in degrees is:
The West-East difference in degrees is: 

Positive longitudes are east of the prime meridian, and negative ones are west.

For the US: We choose the following coordinates:
West: 96 W -96
North:40 N +40
East: 86 W -86
South: 30 N +30

i.e. Alabama, Louisana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi


For China: We choose the following coordinates:
West: 105 E +105
North: 35 N +35
East: 115 E +115
South: 25 N +25

i.e. the Southeastern "Non-Coast" region of China
