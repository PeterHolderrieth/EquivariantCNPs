This folder is supposed to contain
a train, validation and test data set in the subfolder Data/.
This data should contain the geostrophic current from six regions in the Mediterranean Sea.
Train: 60 000 samples - all regions without bengasi
Valid: 15000 samples - all regions without bengasi
Test 1: 15000 samples - all regions without bengasi
Test 2: 60 000 samples - only data from bengasi region

Different options:
1. Mix all, i.e. test and train distribution is completely the sample 
2. Test set contains from different parts of the ocean 
3. Two test sets: A. One with same distribution B. One with a different distribution (i.e. different region)
(Probably opt for 3.)

The regions are in coordinates North East South West:
[
['cyprus1', 35,30,32,27],
['cyprus2', 36,32,33,29],
['malta1',38.5,20,35.5,17],
['malta2',34.5,19.,31.5,16.],
['marseille',42.5,8,39.5,5],
['algier',40.5,8,37.5,5],
['bengasi,36,23,33,20]
]


To do: 
- make extraction for one data file:
    what to do with NAs? What if there is an island?
    which exact variables to keep? Anomalies and actualy current? I would suggest to train on anomalies since
    I do not believe 

- download full data and perform extraction for whole data set
