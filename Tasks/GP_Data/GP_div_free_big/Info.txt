This folder provides the task of predicting a dataset of GP samples. The properties of that data set are as follows:

Every batch of shape [(batch_size,n,2),(batch_size,n,2)]=[X,Y] provides locations X and corresponding vectors Y.
These are sampled from a GP with the following parameters:

GP_parameters={'l_scale':1,
'sigma_var': 2., 
'kernel_type':"div_free",
'obs_noise':1e-4}

The X-locations were chosen as a grid where every is created by torch.linspace(-2,2,10).
So n=100 here.

The number of samples is 10 000.
