This folder provides the task of predicting a dataset of GP samples. The properties of that data set are as follows:

The parameters for sampling the GP are:

GP_parameters={'l_scale':0.5,
'sigma_var': 2., 
'kernel_type':"div_free",
'obs_noise':1e-4}

The X-locations were chosen as a grid where every is created by torch.linspace(-2,2,20).
So n=100 here.

The number of training samples is 50 000, the number of validation and test samples is each 10 000.
